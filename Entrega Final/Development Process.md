### Individual reports

+ Jesús Andrei Torres Landero:

***First report***: Although I like the project, I think we may have problems with not having experience with javascript, I think we need more organization, for now we are investigating about the apis that we can use

***Second report***: 
After discussing many ideas we have decided which tools to use, I began to investigate which database we can use while the tests will be done locally

***Final report***: 
+ Jose Angel Ruiz Escalante:

***First report***: We plan to make an interactive map in which the events, faculty buildings can be seen and thus achieve a better organization of them to help students and external people.

***Second report***: Research on the use of the Bootstrap framework and the Lefleat OpenStreetMap API.
