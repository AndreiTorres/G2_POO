# Project: Croquis FMAT

# Objetive: 

Guide the general public of FMAT, through an adaptive web page,
which shows the different events and activities, with their respective additional information and
specific to each one, which will be carried out officially by the same faculty, to have an order,
scheduling and location.

# Problem: 

The faculty is a place in which different events are organized each week and also in which there are different locations,
such as bathrooms, cafeteria, lounges, cubicles, among others; Due to this, as students of said institution,
We have noticed the need to have a space in which the different activities that take place are organized, as well as
the information of the different teachers and academic staff, since they have different offices at their disposal
disposition and thus achieve a faster search of the spaces.
