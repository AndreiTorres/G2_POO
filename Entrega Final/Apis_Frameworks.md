## Firestore

Cloud Firestore is a flexible and scalable database for server, mobile, and web development from Firebase and Google Cloud. Like Firebase Realtime Database, it keeps your data in sync between client apps through listeners in real time and offers offline support for mobile devices and the web, so you can build responsive apps that work no matter what the network latency or internet connectivity. Cloud Firestore also offers seamless integration with other Firebase and Google Cloud products, including Cloud Functions.

### Why we used it?

Like Realtime Database, Cloud Firestore uses data synchronization to update data from any connected device. However, it is also designed to run single and simple recovery queries efficiently.
